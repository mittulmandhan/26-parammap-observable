In the previous code we used snapshot of the activated route to read route parameter but this approach has a drawback.

Now we will see what the drawbacks are and how to overcome them.

we have added previous and next button in the view.

when we will click the previous button we will go to previous department in the sequence and to next department when click the next button.

drawback of the snapshot approach is that if we click on next or previous button the url changes but the view remains the same.

To change the url and view on the click we use paramMap Observable.

In this code ParamMap observable is added in the department-detail component.
